# OpenStreetMap-Road-Graph-Processor
A Java application that loads a road network from an OpenStreetMap (.osm) XML file, builds a directed weighted graph, and performs classical graph algorithms such as Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, and graph compression. It also provides a command-line interface for interacting with the map and even opens shortest paths directly in Google Maps.
